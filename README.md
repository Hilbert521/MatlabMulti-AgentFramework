# MATLAB -- A Multi-Agent Framework
The present project was based on the Mesa Python Project: https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

> It is composed of three main modules: the model, the agent and the time module.

The model module represents the environment and encapsulates both the agent and the time modules.

The agent module determines the agents' behaviour.

The time module, in turn, is reponsible for the scheduling and activation of agents.
